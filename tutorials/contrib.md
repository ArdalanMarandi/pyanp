# 1. Install Python + Jupyter
See our [tutorial on this topic](install.md)

# 2. Install a Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
I use Pycharm CE by Jetbrains.  It can be found at:

[Pycharm Download](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)

And choose the **Community Edition** 

# 3. Install a git client and get the source code
For now the code for this project is hosted at github.com.  The easiest way to access
the code is to:

1. [Install github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Create an account on https://github.com/join
3. <a href="https://github.com/wjladams/pyanp">Click here to clone in github desktop</a>
4. Click the clone or download button in the upper right and  then either:
  a. Click "Open in Desktop" to clone in github desktop, or
  b. Click the copy button to copy the url for the repo, and use git clone as normal to clone the repository.
