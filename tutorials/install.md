## 1. What is Python, Jupyter and a Jupyter notebook?

* **Python** is a scripting programming language that is used for many mathematical and computer science research projects, in addition to many other applications.  For more information see https://www.python.org/
* **Jupyter** is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.  For more information see http://jupyter.org/
* **A Jupyter Notebook** is a document in the Jupyter application that includes live code, text (with markdown support), equations (including LaTeX support).  It supports Julia, Python, and R languages behind the scenes (which is where the name came from), with the ability to support many many others.
* **Anaconda** is a distribution of python with loads of extra libraries already bundles (e.g. scipy, pandas, numpy, and many more) that also includes Jupyter.  It is the fastest way to get started with Jupyter and Python.
